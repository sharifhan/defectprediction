Text mining - steps for data prepocessing and feature selection

1. Split the randomized raw data in 50/50 ratio [train, test]
2. Prepare train data for text-mining [lower, stopwords, remove-numbers-punctuation-whitespace, stemming]
3. Classify [NB, DT] with train dataset
	a. Apply test dataset
4. Feature selection
	a. Filter
	b. Wrapper
5. Classify with Filter [best classifier from 3]
	a. repeat without the first feature in the rank
	b. repeat without the first two features in the rank
	c. decide if the top two features make any difference in classification accuracy
6. Classify with Wrapper [best classifier from 3]
	a. repeat for the alternative wrapper subset
7. Conclude which Feature-Classifier combination has the highest accuracy
